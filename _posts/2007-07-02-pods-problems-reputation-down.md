I&#8217;ve been ridiculously busy packing and moving. I think the hard part is over now. I&#8217;ve finished packing up and moving out of my place in Falls Church, VA. I&#8217;ve driven me and my cats to Burlington, VT (10 hour drive with whining Catsâ€¦ Aaaaaaaaaaa!) Now I just need my stuff to show up in Burlington!

It actually been quite the pain in the you know what. I made the mistake of using the PODS Enterprises, Inc.: Portable On Demand Storage. It seemed like a good idea at the time because I could do my packing over a couple weeks instead of the three days that all the other options required. But it turns out the company&#8217;s customer service is awful. The first big problem is they won&#8217;t deliver to my apartment, for unexplained reasons the Burlington area of off limits. So instead they are transporting my stuff to the closest warehouse which is in Schenectady, NY. So I have to figure out how to haul it the rest of the way myself&#8230; Uggg.

To make matters worst the PODS Enterprises doesn&#8217;t understand how to make delivery schedules. I asked them to transport my pod so that I could access it on July 7th. They do not understand this and instead are planning to deliver my pod to warehouse that day but won&#8217;t let me make an appointment to access it because they don&#8217;t know exactly when it will arrive! I&#8217;ve called and complained several times now and no one will do anything about this massive mistake. I&#8217;ve also been hung up on twice, and sent to the &#8220;leave a message&#8221; recording countless times.

In conclusion I regret having used the PODS Company very much.
