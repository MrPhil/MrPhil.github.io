&#8220;The journey to Marble Blast on the 360 has finally come to an end. Today at around 2:30pm PST, the game went up on XBox Live Arcade servers. Since then, over 1000 people have posted high scores on the leaderboards, and the online forums have lit up with discussion of the game.&#8221; says Alex Swanson of GarageGames in his nice post doing a quick post mortems of art production. Even if you don&#8217;t read it, it is worth looking at the pretty pictures of the marble reflecting its surroundings. [Link](http://www.torquepowered.com/community/blogs/view/9636)
