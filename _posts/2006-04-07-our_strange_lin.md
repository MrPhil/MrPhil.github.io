When the English tongue we speak.
  
Why is break not rhymed with freak?
  
Will you tell me why it&#8217;s true
  
We say sew but likewise few?
  
And the maker of the verse,
  
Cannot rhyme his horse with worse?
  
Beard is not the same as heard
  
Cord is different from word.
  
Cow is cow but low is low
  
Shoe is never rhymed with foe.
  
Think of hose, dose, and lose
  
And think of goose and yet with choose
  
Think of comb, tomb and bomb,
  
Doll and roll or home and some.
  
Since pay is rhymed with say
  
Why not paid with said I pray?
  
Think of blood, food and good.
  
Mould is not pronounced like could.
  
Wherefore done, but gone and lone &#8211;
  
Is there any reason known?
  
To sum up all, it seems to me
  
Sound and letters don&#8217;t agree.
