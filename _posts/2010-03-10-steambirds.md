    SteamBirds, planes and dog fights!
  </p>
</div>

Imagine if someone updated that old Atari combat game.  You know, the one with the planes flying in circle and hiding behind the pixel cloud.  Mix in a story about cold fusion, make it turn based and you&#8217;d have: [Steam Birds](http://armorgames.com/play/5426/steambirds) The interface is well done, and a joy to interact with.   The story is interesting, fusion is discovered in the 1800s!?!
