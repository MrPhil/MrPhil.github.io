I&#8217;ve recently decided to move my source control from my local visual SourceSafe setup to a subversion hosting company. A host can provide better security through features like power backup, security monitoring, RAID 5 etc. Sure, I could set all this up myself, but that is time Iâ€™m not putting into my game. I believe this is a core strategy to success. Every time I find away to get someone else to do a task it means more time to put it into my games. Plus, if my house burns down (knocks on wood) my code is completely safe and secure.
