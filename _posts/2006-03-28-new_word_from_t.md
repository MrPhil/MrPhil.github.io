My family lives on the Gulf Coast.  They survived hurricane Katrina, but not much of their stuff did.   I recently noticed they have begun using an interesting new word and I&#8217;m going to start working into my everyday vocabulary.

KATRINAED – something whose usefulness has been drastically lower by uncontrollable and usually outside forces. Ex. That&#8217;s my katrinaed boat which I keep my tax records in now.
