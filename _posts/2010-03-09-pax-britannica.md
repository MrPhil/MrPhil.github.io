Found this wonderful space strategy game called Pax Britannica.  It&#8217;s more of a demo, but good for a few minutes of fun.  I like the interesting trade off between time, the need for superior numbers and the fighter&#8217;s need to be launched in large groups to be effective.  The game is a the results [GAMMA IV](http://www.kokoromi.org/gamma4/) which, I belive is a game development contest.  It appears theme was &#8220;one button.&#8221;
