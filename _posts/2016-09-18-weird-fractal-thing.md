  It isn&#8217;t a game, but I made this interesting looking thing, a sort of moving fractal. I know my Grandpa would have thought it was cool because he loved math and fractals where one of the things that drew him to computers. The fractals he made didn&#8217;t move, but he did use color animation to give it the feeling of moving, but this kind of movement would is like a whole new world.
