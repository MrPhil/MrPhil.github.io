Blessed are the fruits of the earth and sea and sky.
  
Blessed is this planet, miraculously spinning in space, sustaining human life in this vast cosmos.
  
Blessed are the gifts of family and friends and the joy of being together.
  
We give thanks this day for this food which nurtures and sustains our bodies and for these people who nurture and sustain our minds, souls and hearts.
  
We give thanks for those who cannot be with us this day; either through accidents of space or time or history, but who are part of us nonetheless, in influence and memory and esteem.
  
Blessed are we indeed.
  
Happy Thanksgiving.
