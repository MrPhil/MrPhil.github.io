Jonathan Blow did an Ask Me Anything on Reddit Friday: [I am Jonathan Blow, game development person; ask me stuff.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/45fu74/i_am_jonathan_blow_game_development_person_ask_me/)

I was specifically interesting in advice type tidbits, here are my notes.

**Who Is Jonathan Blow?**
  
Game designer and programmer for the games [Braid](http://braid-game.com/) and [The Witness](http://the-witness.net/); Partner in angle investor [Indie Fund](http://indie-fund.com/); And creator of programming [JAI](http://www.mrphilgames.com/jai/).

**What advise do you have for aspiring game designers?**

  * #1 advice for the creative process, do &#8220;**_Deep Work&#8221;_** as explained in this lecture: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0m0jIzJfiQ&index=3&list=PL\_c7zXuU-zzfg3nxNmQp8IYpR\_TO0UNj3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0m0jIzJfiQ&index=3&list=PL_c7zXuU-zzfg3nxNmQp8IYpR_TO0UNj3)
  * Ideas aren&#8217;t worth much, it is execution that matter.
  * Learn to program, because then you can create your vision. (see above)
  * Take on ambitious projects
  * Design is an interactive process, try stuff, keep what works, throw out what doesn&#8217;t.
  * **&#8220;_In fiction writing, there is this concept that you want every sentence to do more than one thing: you want to describe the setting and set the mood and introduce the character. You want to say what happened and show how a character feels about it and foreshadow a later consequence._&#8220;**
  * Video&#8217;s that go in depth about the puzzle creation process (some is universal to game design):

      * <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul_ZfzfHRek>
      * <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LDJt9zS8ko>
  * Do not listen to the Internet: **_&#8220;The internet is an extremely distorted lens. It is basically useless for understanding how your game is really reaching people.&#8221;_**
  * How did you keep at it for so long without giving up? _**&#8220;There are low points, as with anything, but you just know what what you are working on is good, and you keep going. 7 years is not that long. If you watch a movie like [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-aGPniFvS0) you&#8217;ll see someone who is very serious and for whom 7 years is no big deal.&#8221;**_
  * How much time do you put into the craft of making games?  _**&#8220;Most of them.&#8221;**_

**What games to you recommend?**
