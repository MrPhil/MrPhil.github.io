Got the portal code all organized today and into the Vault, thanks SourceGear. It was a bugger because the Visual Studio 2003 got confused about the virtual directory. But I figured out that with web projects the hosts address is stored in the .csproj.webinfo file which you can edit to fix the problem. I think next I&#8217;ll work on a pic gallery tool.
