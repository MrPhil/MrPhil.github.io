**Week 2**

**Idea:** Strategy game about screening army/infantry movements using Calvary ([like Napoleon did](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_tactics#Cavalry_Tactics).)

**What went right:** Nothing really.

**What went wrong:** 1) Day light savings, always, always causes me to have some serious insomnia. I&#8217;ve probably spent at least 20 hours trying to fall asleep this week. 2) Lack of Time, a lot of important things came up and I wasn&#8217;t able to put much time into the idea.

**What I learned:** I spent some time messing with my drag and drop code, but probably should have just banged out a hacky version and moved on. I too easily slip into, &#8220;What IS the right way to do this,&#8221; instead of just banging something out and learning from that.

**Feelings:** Meh, Life Happens (I don&#8217;t know how you say that in feeling words.)

**Play** _(Warning is is completely unplayable!)_
