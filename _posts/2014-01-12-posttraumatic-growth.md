We often hear of Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD, especially associated with combat veterans and difficulties they face returning home, but did you know there is a positive version of PTSD called Posttraumatic Growth? Game designer Jane McGonigal and author of [_Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make us Better and How they Can Change the World_](http://www.amazon.com/Reality-Is-Broken-Better-Change/dp/0143120611) found herself in a troubling situation. After a sever injury to her head, she began having suicidal thoughts! Her solution was to gamify her recovery! The game is called [SuperBetter](https://www.superbetter.com/)!

She gave a Ted Talk about the experience: [Jane McGonigal: The game that can give you 10 extra years of life](http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_the_game_that_can_give_you_10_extra_years_of_life.html)
