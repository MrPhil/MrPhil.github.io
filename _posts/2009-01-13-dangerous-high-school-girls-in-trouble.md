      Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble! &#8211; Fib, flirt and taunt in the game where good girls get better by being bad! You start by gathering a gang of girls to investigate suspicious accidents that have been happening at your high school, but little did you know that you were on your way to discovering your town&#8217;s destructive secret! Confront oppressive adults and malicious peers with naughty little games, where each victory gives you more talent to face tougher foes! Well-behaved women seldom make history, so what are you waiting for?
