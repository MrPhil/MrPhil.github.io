[Studies show that gamer&#8217;s brains work better and are more resilient to aging.](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/12/gamers_are_as_good_a.html)

&#8220;A new study of 100 university undergraduates in Toronto has found that video gamers consistently outperform their non-playing peers in a series of tricky mental tests. If they also happened to be bilingual, they were unbeatable.&#8221;

Ironically the researcher ends the article with the typical anti-game blather: &#8220;I&#8217;d still be plenty concerned if my child played them all the time,&#8221; Prof. Bialystok said. &#8220;Sure, they&#8217;re getting better at rapid search and response problems, but I really would prefer my child read a book.&#8221;
