After my [post, Video Games Help Kids,](/video_games_hel/) a couple weeks ago I didn&#8217;t expect more related news to come out so soon.  But here it is, Yahoo! has a related article today: [Video game helps young people blast cancer](http://www.hopelab.org/docs/Reuters040206.pdf) It’s actual about a scientific study that was done.  The study &#8220;showed that young people who played &#8220;Re-Mission&#8221; were more likely to stick to their medication regimens than those who did not.&#8221;  It is an example of games helping children and teenagers better understand the world around them and therefore take better care of themselves.  Can&#8217;t wait to see what other innovations are discovered!  The game can be downloaded for free from [HopeLab.](http://www.hopelab.org/)
