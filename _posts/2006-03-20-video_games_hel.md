I read this fascinating article on News.com: [Video game therapy&#8211;a new frontier](http://news.com.com/Video%20game%20therapy--a%20new%20frontier/2100-1043_3-6051269.html?tag=nefd.top). It is about how video games are being used to help children with brain damage recover! These creative uses of video games are sure to grow more amazing over time. I hope that eventually the general public comes to recognize that video games, like anything else in the world, have positives and negatives. I also hope they also come to understand that governments should not be allowed to make something illegal just because it has some bad qualities. Politician do not really wants to apply their philosophy of “bad and mean stuff should illegal” to the real world because this would mean outlawing the car.  Did you know car accidents are one of the most common causes of death ([US](http://www.the-eggman.com/writings/death_stats.html))? How about the fact that over 43,000 people a year dies in car accidents? Would it surprise you to know that it is the number one killer in people ages 1 to 34? Don’t let the politicians fool you; they don’t have your best interest at heart. Their real goal is getting headlines, media coverage, and securing that cushy six figure salary for another term.
