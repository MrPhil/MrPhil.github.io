Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m in the process of moving my blogÂ _MrPhil Makes Games_ here. Unfortunately the system (me) is very slow at finding and moving my old posts. Please be patient with the system, it has a day job still.

In the mean time you can find most of my old posts atÂ [MrPhil.name](http://web.archive.org/web/20070518134131/http://mrphil.name/) and a couple atÂ [http://mrphilmakesgames.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070518134131/http://mrphilmakesgames.com/) (originally I was going to move my blog there but I came up with a much better planâ€¦ moving it here ðŸ˜‰ )

Thank you!
