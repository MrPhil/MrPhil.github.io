**Update:** Unity has announced some changes here: <http://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/06/16/evolution-of-our-products-and-pricing/>  I&#8217;ve made edits below to reflect them.

  1. There will not be a **Unity 6,** just continual improvements.
  2. All **Platforms**
  3. All **Royalty Free**
  4. All **Engine Features**
  5. _**Personal**_ will remain free, limits revenue to **$100,000 a year** and you must show a **Made With Unity** splash screen.
  6. _**Plus**_ is $35 a month and gives you nice to haves, like priority in the **Cloud Build** queue, limits revenue to **$200,000 a year**, the **Made With Unity** splash screen is **optional** and the **dark theme** is included.
  7. **Pro,** after **24 months** of paying for a subscription you can quit paying and **keep your current version** (but you don&#8217;t get any more updates, support or services but you do get the **next three patches**.)
  8. If you have a subscription now and/or a perpetual licenses:

> <p class="p1">
>   <span class="s1">We will launch the new products soon, for new customers to buy. </span>As an existing Unity 5.x perpetual license customer, you will no longer get new updates after March 2017. However, you have a few options if you want to keep getting updates:
> </p>

  1. > For up to five seats, you may subscribe to Unity Pro at the special price of $75 per month for a limited transition period, after which the price will revert to the normal subscription price of $125 per month:
    > 
    >   * If Unity 5 Pro is your first version of Unity, your transition period is one year.
    >   * If you owned Unity 4 Pro, your transition period is two years.

  2. > If you make less than $200k per year, you may choose Unity Plus and pay $35 per month with an annual commitment.
