    I&#8217;ve created a new logo for the blog part of the site. What do you think? I think it looks pretty good. I guess my programmer art skills are improving. I wonder if one day I&#8217;ll graduate to the next level? I wonder what it is call?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    You might also have noticed that I moved the 3rd party games I sell to there own subdomain: games.mrphilgames.com. Changes in the market place have reduced the reward of running that part of the site and so I&#8217;ll be deemphasizing it over the next few months. This is good because my energy is going into Iron Roads instead (and hopefully other strategy games titles down the road.)
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    I&#8217;ve also decided to use SilverLight for Iron Roads, which means you&#8217;ll be able to play it in the browser. There are two main reasons I choose this. One, is I wanted to work in C#. It is a language I know well, enjoy working in and has the benefit of all the smart people at Microsoft continually improving it and its’ tools. Second, I want the Mac People to be able to play. That&#8217;s right! SilverLight works on Apple&#8217;s browser too!
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    There is a sort third thing that was in the back of my mind when I made this decision. SilverLight 3.0 will have an offline mode, that will let applications install to the Start menu. So down the road people will be able to play even if they aren’t connected to the internet!
