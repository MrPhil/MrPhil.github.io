[This is an amazing video of a sun flare.](http://www.mrphilgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/ar9906_trace.mpg) The TRACE satellite caught this flare which is what they call an X-Class flare, one of the largest and the kind responsible for blackouts and communication disruption. These loops are generating massive radiation and are estimated to be hotter than ten million degrees!
