There is game called [Small Worlds by David Shute](http://lackofbanjos.com/games/small-worlds/) I want take a moment to highlight. I played it back in 2009, and it won CGDC #6. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times this game has entered my thoughts during brainstorming sessions. Here are several reason I can identify why this game has stuck in my mind. First, its beautiful art. Â The fact that it is pixel art adds to my amazement. It seems within grasp of my art ability, but I doubt it, all great art seems easy. Second, the game is compelling, you want to know the story behind the world and your character. The story moves forwards because of the scenery, not because of what anyone says. The visuals hint at what has happen and propels you forward, you must know. Third, the music (by [Kevin MacLeod](http://incompetech.com/)) is wonderful. It adds the perfect atmosphere which induces this compelling feeling of wonder and amazement.
