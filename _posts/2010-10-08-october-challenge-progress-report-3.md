It was a real fight tonight getting the &#8220;Win&#8221; to be displayed nicely and in red. Took me a while to understand the relationship between the GUIText and a font material. Brother, sure wish I had figured it out faster.

On the business hat side of things I discovered that [PayPal now has a microtransation option](https://www.paypalobjects.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_micropayments.html) to their pricing structure and signed up. I have my reservations about the trustworthiness of PayPal after all the stories I&#8217;ve heard, but this will be my best option if I price Stacker at $1 like I was thinking.
