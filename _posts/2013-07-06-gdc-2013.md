This was my best GDC yet.  I had some great business cards, my resume and something to talk about: founding and running the [Washington DC Area Unity3D Users&#8217; Group.](http://www.WAUUG.com/)  I had a wonderful time, did the most networking of my life and came home very inspired!  I even got to meet and chat with Matthew Davis one of the creators of [FTL](http://www.ftlgame.com/).  [(WHAT!  You haven&#8217;t played FTL!! GO BUY IT NOW!!! )](http://www.ftlgame.com/)

One, bit of fun that happen was [Cart Life won the IGF Nuovo award](http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html#cart).  Cart Life&#8217;s creator Richard Hofmeier decided to deface the award sign and hand the booth over to [howling dogs by Propentine](http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/howlingdogs/howlingdogs.html#2o).

On the last day of the trip, I decided to go to the Dutch Game Garden at their consult.  I met of [Maarten Wiedenh of Reus](http://www.reusgame.com/) which he is playing in the picture above.  It&#8217;s a cool game about Gods and planet building, its worth getting.  On the way, a monk approached me and gave me the &#8220;Work Smoothly&#8221; medal pictured above.  It struck me as smart way to think about working , &#8220;Work Smoothly.&#8221;  It&#8217;s become a sort of motto now, whenever I get harried or out of sorts I remind myself to get collected and work smoothly.

[Yes, another HORRIBLY late post, cut me some slack!]
