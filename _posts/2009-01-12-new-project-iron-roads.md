&nbsp;

The holidays have kept me so busy I haven&#8217;t talked any about my new project. Another [Ludum Dare 48 Hour](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/) game development contest occurred the weekend of December 5th. It was my fourth time to play and the 13th contest to date. This time the theme was &#8220;Roads.&#8221; Roads turned out to be a very difficult theme. I brainstormed all night Friday before bed (the contests started at 11 pm my time) and then again in the morning for a total of two to three hours. I couldn&#8217;t come up with anything I liked and also seemed simple enough to finish in the 48 hour time limit. So I went with the idea I liked the most, a Railroad Tycoon type business simulator. I confidently and correctly judge I would not finish it in time, but I&#8217;ve got a wonderful start on a game I&#8217;m really excited about. I call it Iron Roads. You can read the few and short posts I made during the contest on the Ludum Dare website: <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/?category_name=ld13&author_name=mrphil" target="_self">MrPhil&#8217;s Iron Roads.</a>
