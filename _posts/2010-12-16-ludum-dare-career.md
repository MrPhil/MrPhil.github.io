Ludum Dare 19 is right around the corner, so let&#8217;s take a moment to review my Ludum Dare Career.

**LD #6 &#8211; Light and Darkness, 2005**
  
[Puzzle Bots &#8211; Incomplete](http://www.mrphilgames.com/tag/ld6/)
  
There is, amazingly, still some [evidence that I particpated in this one.](http://www.mechanicalcat.net/tech/ld48/6/Mr.Phil) Only the Internet Gods know how long that&#8217;ll last, so I harvested the results and added them to my blog under the tag [LD6](http://www.mrphilgames.com/tag/ld6/). My idea was to build a strategy game about photosynthetic organisms battling for light. I got an incomplete.

**LD #7 &#8211; Growth, 2005**
  
<del datetime="2010-12-17T03:03:13+00:00">Name Unknown</del>
  
I may or may not have particapted in this one. I feel like I did, but can find no evidence.

**LD #11 &#8211; Minimalist, 2008**
  
[Battle Magic](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld11/?author_name=mrphil)
  
A game of battling mages with no visuals, just text. It is one of my more successful games, and generated a bit of buzz because people disagreed about the affects the Luck spell had.

**LD #12 &#8211; The Tower, 2008** 
  
[Stacker](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld12/?author_name=mrphil)
  
This is the most playable game I&#8217;ve created. You stack small little yellow cubes higher and higher.

**LD #13 &#8211; Roads, 2008**
  
[Iron Roads &#8211; Incomplete](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld13/?author_name=mrphil)
  
LD13 was interesting because I just used the time to start a larger game, and didn&#8217;t even try to finish. If you look at the comments it got, a lot of people would like to see it completed. I have continued to work on a post-compo version but it has always suffered from being a low priority. I hope it&#8217;ll become my top priority in the second half of 2011.

**LD #16 &#8211; Exploration, 2009**
  
[No name &#8211; Incomplete](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld-16-2009/?author_name=mrphil)
  
I tried to make a space exploration game. I was trying to do something like [Digital Eel&#8217;s Weird Worlds &#8211; Return to Infinite Space](http://www.shrapnelgames.com/Digital_Eel/WW/WW_page.html). I got bogged down by the user interface code and gave-up.

**LD #17 &#8211; Islands, 2010** 
  
[Island Airline](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=165)
  
Islands was another attempt at a strategy game. The player is in charge of an vacation airline. It is playable, but really isn&#8217;t any fun. I think it&#8217;ll be a full game one day.

**LD #18 &#8211; Enemies as Weapons, 2010** 
  
[Deflector Beam](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=165)
  
You&#8217;re the tracker beam operator aboard a UFO and must protect your ship by deflecting the bullets of enemy fighters. It is barely playable and really short.

**MiniLD #10 &#8211; Domestic Violence, 2009**
  
[No Name &#8211; Incomplete](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/minild/minild-10/?author_name=mrphil)
  
This was a very hard theme for me to work with. I did some design, but eventual abandoned the whole idea because it creeped me out.

**MiniLD #16 &#8211; Constraints, 2010**
  
[Yet to be Named RPG &#8211; Incomplete](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/minild/minild-16/?author_name=mrphil)
  
I didn&#8217;t finish a sort of rails squads tactics game.

**October Challenge 2010**
  
[Play/Buy Stacker](/stacker/#Buy) [Dev Log](/category/october-challenge/)
  
I took LD12&#8217;s Stacker made it 3D and gave it obstacles to build around. It is for sale, but it is still very rough around the edges. I have a big face lift planned.

All in all I&#8217;ve participated in 10-11 Ludum Dares of some flavor or another. Notice how I used the word &#8220;participated?&#8221; This is clever of me because several of my attempt are incomplete or ridiculously un-fun. There are a lot of incompletes. I often over reach with my idea and often get stuck pounding out basic infrastructure code. I think I&#8217;m getting better, but I certainly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve conquered this problem. I&#8217;m considering using Unity this time around as a strategy to keep myself from getting stuck in the code details. I am worried, however, that Unity won&#8217;t be flexible enough to execute my ideas in. Unity is a 3D engine, and my art skills are barely only suited for 2D games, much less 3D. Plus, my area of interest tends to be strategy games, which are more about a user interface than a 3D world. I&#8217;m not sure how well Unity will serve these tendencies. So, I have my pile of XNA books and code on standby.
