The top image is an older screen shot so you can better see my progress and the second one I took today.  You have to look hard to see the progress I&#8217;ve made lately but it is there! I&#8217;ve been working on the map editor so I can more easily add cities and adjust thier position.  If you look closely you can see a lot more city dots on the map than before.  I also updated the map so the coast lines and borders are more detailed and therefore more wiggly.

Sorry, this post is such a mess. I&#8217;m planning to move to a better platform soon.
