Iâ€™m accepting [PoV&#8217;s Ludum Dare October Challenge: Make a game, sell 1 copy](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/09/22/povs-challenge-make-a-game-sell-1-copy/). Iâ€™m going to extend and polish [Stacker](/games/stacker/), my Ludum Dare 12 entry. It is the most complete game and best of all my Ludum Dare entries. I also have some ideas about how to make it more interesting than the current scheme of moving the goal line higher and higher each level.

Serendipitously, [Unity 3.0](http://www.Unity3d.com) was released today. Iâ€™ve been eyeing using it in future projects for a few weeks now, and have actually done several tutorials and watched a bunch of videos online. I was particularly impressed with the Visual Studio integration. If I had known about that earlier, I would have tried it much sooner. In the past, engines, frameworks and languages have caused me much gnashing of my teeth because their IDE was so painful.

Come back Oct 30 and see if I won ðŸ˜‰
