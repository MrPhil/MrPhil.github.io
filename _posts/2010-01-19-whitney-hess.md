<span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><span><a href="http://whitneyhess.com/blog/"></a></span></span>I discovered <http://whitneyhess.com/blog/> thanks to <http://www.gaminghorror.net/> today and watched her presentation [Evangelizing Yourself](http://www.slideshare.net/whitneyhess/evangelizing-yourself-1184852).  It&#8217;s interesting, and I don&#8217;t disagree with anything she said, but I do wonder if it really applies to everyone.  I think programmers and game designers do blog a lot about their field, but I also think evangelizing is a goal in itself.  Writing isn&#8217;t easy and promoting yourself might not be where you want to spend your time.  But, you should still watch it, you learn a little about marketing and even more about networking and confidence.
