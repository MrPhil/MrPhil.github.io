Reflexive Arcade is doing something amazing for its affiliates! They are allowing us to participate in the launch of Ricochet Infinity. This means I have a brand spanking New Release that not even Big Fish Games or PopCap have! Sweet. In honor of this special moment I’ve made Ricochet Infinity [Game of the Moment!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113153959/http://www.mrphilgames.com/default.aspx) It is a pretty cool game, very polished and full of action. It makes my brain buzz. So, it is definitely worthy of the honor. Here I’ll even ad an image. That&#8217;s how excited I am! Okay&#8230; it’s late&#8230; Must&#8230; go to Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
