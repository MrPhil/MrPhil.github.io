[Jeff Tunnell of Garage Games has launched a new blog site call Make It Big In Games.](http://makeitbigingames.com/)

&#8220;Six years ago when we started GarageGames I didn&#8217;t truly know if &#8220;indies&#8221; could succeed in making a living making games without large publisher support. In fact, unaffiliated game developers were not even called indies back then, but we didn&#8217;t like the name &#8220;shareware developer&#8221;, so we used the name indie and it stuck. Now I absolutely know you can make a living making games, and I have developed many strategies to help you succeed.

Iâ€™ll explore those ideas in future posts, and hope to make it into a two way street by having a companion wiki at makeitbigingames wiki. The MBG wiki is open, but not ready for prime time yet, so look for it in the future.&#8221;

Good luck Jeff! Link
