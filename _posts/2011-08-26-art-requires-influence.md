These are some thought provoking videos about the origin of art and creativity.  I recommend you watch them:

  * [Everything is a Remix Part 1 ](http://vimeo.com/14912890)
  * [Everything is a Remix Part 2](http://vimeo.com/19447662)

  It is hard to argue against the point that in order to create you must understand what has already been done and then put your mark on it.  Maybe I should make some &#8220;copy&#8221; games in the same way that Hunter S. Thomas retyped the Great Gatsby.
