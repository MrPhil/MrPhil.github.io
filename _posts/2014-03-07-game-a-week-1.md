[Adriel Wallick&#8217;s wonderful post-mortem about her Game A Week experiment](http://gamasutra.com/blogs/AdrielWallick/20140226/211761/Make_Many_Games_Learn_Many_Things.php) inspired me to try it out.

**Week 1**

**Idea:** How many games of pong can a human play at once.

**What went right:** 1) Unity, I got it up and running fairly fast with very little code. 2) You can play it.

**What went wrong:** 1) Work got busy and I had to put in some overtime. This reduced the energy and time I could put into the game. 2) I also ran into troubles with Unity&#8217;s 2D physics and spent a fair amount of time fiddling with it.

**What I learned:** I need to either match the idea I pick with Unity features I already understand, or accommodate &#8220;research&#8221; time when considering the viability an idea if it needs a feature or area of Unity I haven&#8217;t used before.

**Feelings:** Anger, Hate, Frustration, Disappointment, Helplessness, Guilty, Embarrassed, Let down

**Play**
