This weekend I hauled myself down to DC to attend the [SilverLight DevCamp DC](http://www.barcamp.org/SilverlightDevCampDC).  I learned quite a few things so I’ve decided, instead of one really long post about it all I’d do a series of quick posts about the things I learned.

I’d like to send a big THANK YOU to [Frank La Vigne](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://www.franksworld.com/) for organizing this event and recognize all the speakers because they did this as volenteers:

  * [Dr Z](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://blogs.msdn.com/zxue/)
  * Vishwas Lele
  * [Rob Zelt](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://www.mrphilgames.com/mrphil/www.robzelt.com/blog/)
  * [Andrew Duthie](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://www.mrphilgames.com/mrphil/blogs.msdn.com/gduthie/)
  * [Pete Brown](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://community.irritatedvowel.com/blogs/pete_browns_blog/default.aspx)
  * [Kevin Jones](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://community.strongcoders.com/blogs/vcsjones/default.aspx)
  * [Dani Diaz](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://blogs.msdn.com/dani/default.aspx)

Apparently I came the furthest for the event and so was given a free copy of the just released <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SilverLight 1.0 Unleashed</span>.  I was quite happy because it was a book I was thinking about getting.  If that wasn&#8217;t surprise enough the book is filled with bright colors!

#### SilverLight DevCamp DC Nuggest #1

The first nugget I&#8217;ll share is that a Windows Mobile version of SilverLight is in the works.  [Apparently there was a working demo at MIX07 and I found a video of the presentation by MLB.com, the mobile part is right at the end.](http://web.archive.org/web/20071117013220/http://www.visitmix.com/Blogs/Joshua/major-league-baseball-mix07-demo/)
