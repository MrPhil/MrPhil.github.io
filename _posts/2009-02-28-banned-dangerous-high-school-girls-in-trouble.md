Ironically, the award winning [Dangerous High School Girls in Trouble](http://www.mousechief.com/dhsg/index.html) has been banned by Big Fish Games. Apparently, there are some adult scenes that have offend many of Big Fish Games customers. Oddly enough, they are using the [Teen rating from TIGRS](http://www.tigrs.org/rating.php?data=21200000121110) so I am not sure why they are surprised.

This is a difficult development for [Mousecheif](http://www.mousechief.com/) and I encourage everyone to please support this truly independent and creative game. Don&#8217;t let the message be that developers need to &#8220;dumb down&#8221; their stories.
