<p style="text-align: left;">
  I added The Last Sleeper to my list of Kickstart projects today.  I really think the music by Erik Aadahl is well done.  The latest update has a nice track, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/78728598/the-last-sleeper-episode-1/posts/161904">you should take a listen</a>  I&#8217;m also intrigued by the story of the game, and it sounds like the game designer has face some serious adversity getting the project this far.  Add your support, only a few hours left!
