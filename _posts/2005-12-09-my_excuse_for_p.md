I&#8217;ve found the perfect excuse to procrastinate Christmas shopping for the entire weekend! The [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/) starts tonight at midnight! What Ludum Dare? It is a 48-hour game programming contest. I participated last year, and hopefully will be able to top my past performance.
