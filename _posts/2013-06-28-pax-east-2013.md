I went to PAX East!  My first PAX.  It was overwhelming and I had a great time.  I was so busy going to panels and meeting people I didn&#8217;t really do much else.  I meet a lot of awesome indie developers including [Michael Carriere](http://www.zapdot.com/) from [Boston Indies](http://www.bostonindies.com/).  DC&#8217;s own, the wonderful, [Miellyn Fitzwater Barrows](http://gorgeousrobot.com/about/) the writer behind [Strange Loves: Vampire Boyfriends](http://gamebookadventures.com/gamebooks/strange-loves-vampire-boyfriends/) was on the panel _Foreplay: Romance in Games_.

I pitched Iron Roads to a lot of people and the feedback helped me evolved my vision for the game.  I even made my pitched to the Pitch Panel the last day:  [Here I am pitching the game to Kris Straub, Jeff Kalles and Eric Neustadter at PAX East 2013.](http://www.twitch.tv/pax/b/381739385?t=135m26s)  They didn&#8217;t like the idea but several people emailed me and Tweeted that they thought the idea was grand.  That gave me a lot of encouragement and a small prod to start a Facebook page for the game <https://www.facebook.com/IronRoads>

[Yes, I know this post is HORRIBLY late, but once I catch up it&#8217;ll all make sense, stay tuned.]
