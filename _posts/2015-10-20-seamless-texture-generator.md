Exciting news! I&#8217;ve become the owner of Seamless Texture Generator which is a great tool for making tile textures for games (and other stuff) out of images. It work really well and part of the reason I bough the IP is because of how well it works. Here&#8217;s an example:

<img class="alignnone" src="http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/example-006-input.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="512" /> &#8212;->   <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/example-006-output.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="512" />

Notice how even the jarring seem created by the cement bag is smoothed away.

See for yourself, there is a free demo: <http://www.seamlesstexturegenerator.com/>

The program is pretty old and doesn&#8217;t support Windows 10, but I&#8217;m hoping to write a new version down the road.
