Here&#8217;s a small tech demo I&#8217;ve been working on. It&#8217;s the application of the [Voronoi Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) to a map&#8217;s political boundaries as two players place bases or cities. It was written in Unity3D and essentially the system continuously loops over each cube and determines which of the existing bases (or mouse) is closest. One quirk, is there is a limit to how far away a cube can be or it will simply remain neutral. I have several different ideas about how to apply this to a game but I&#8217;m still searching for a theme that fits the mechanic very well.
