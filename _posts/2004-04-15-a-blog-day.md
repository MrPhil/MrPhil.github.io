Lately I&#8217;ve found myself reading a blog because I&#8217;ll come across them while hunting for a coding solution, technology, news etc on the web. It has surprised me how quickly they are leading to rich answers. So much so that I&#8217;ve started checking a few on a regular basis. So I felt compelled to create an account with www.bloglines.com. It was free, and quick to setup, and will probably serve me for now.
