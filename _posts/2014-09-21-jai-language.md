Jonathan Blow of Braid fame gave a really interesting Twitch/YouTube talks about making a new language to replace C/C++ that is specifically for making games with: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ> .  I&#8217;m very interested and his rationals resonates a lot with me.  I gave up C/C++ long, long ago because it was so messy and conveluted.  This could totally bring me back to a &#8220;bare metal&#8221; language. I started a reference page to collect links, etc: <http://www.mrphilgames.com/jai/>
