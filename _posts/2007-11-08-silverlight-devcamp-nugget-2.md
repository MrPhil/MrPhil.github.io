## <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Here are several gotchas I learned about at SilverLight DevCamp DC. You might not even understand what some of these are talking about, but hopefully by the end of this series you will.</span>

  * Keyboard input doesn’t work right for fullscreen mode
  * Blend’s Media encoding fails sometimes
  * You need to deploy debug (.pdb) files in order for Firefox to work
  * You need to save the root element passed during the onload event so you can do a find controls with it later
  * Validation and intellisense don’t work right in xaml files
  * Attached properties don’t show-up in intellisense
  * Do not start animations in the constructor
  * No design time support for UserControls in Blend
