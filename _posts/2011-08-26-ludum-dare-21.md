I&#8217;m about half way throught this weekend&#8217;s [Ludum Dare 21](http://www.ludumdare.com) (althought the traffic level is really bad right now.)  The theme is _Escape_.

Tools so far:

  * [Unity3d 3.4](http://unity3d.com/)
  * [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio)
  * [Paint](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/paint)

My Pac Man mechanic isn&#8217;t exactly fun, but it too late in the contest now to change 🙁   I&#8217;m using momentum or forces to move the player, which at least one interesting difference over the classic game.  This make moving around a little less straight forward, and might have some emergent strategies, we&#8217;ll see.

Interesting! [Notch](http://notch.tumblr.com/) of [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/) fame is [video streaming live as he programs his Ludum Dare 21 entry](http://twitch.tv/realnotch)!!
