Hi, my name is Mr.Phil. I have a problem. It&#8217;s a complicated problem, a mix of &#8220;do-it-all-yourself-itous&#8221; and always &#8220;biting off more than I can chew.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve probably started and scrapped more projects than most people have funny t-shirts in there wardrobe. So my struggle continues. Since March I&#8217;ve learned python, and played with PyTorque, I also put some more work into my C# game engine and then got depressed by my lack of progress and went to the beach and drank beer, for several weekends.

So, now I&#8217;m feeling better and I&#8217;ve decided in order to make myself stick to a project and finish it I need to write out in detail what I am doing, and why it makes the most sense to do.

What is the game?
  
I&#8217;m still 100% commitment to my space empire builder game. That hasn&#8217;t changed, but now I&#8217;ve pared the concept down to a much simpler starting point. I&#8217;m envisioning simple game play like Diplomacy or Risk, with ever so slightly more unit types. Then down the road after it is done I can make new versions that expands things until over time the full vision is realized.

This is a good idea because it small, simply and not overly complex. It shouldn&#8217;t take me a long time to get the general game play working, and then I can polish it up. It&#8217;s also good because it is a visible step towards the total vision of the game and my motivation to make the game is very high and what has kept me at this over the years. I know trying to doing anything else would be fool hardy.

Why I&#8217;m going to use T2D?
  
It comes down to two important things: priorities and the scarcity of time. I would love to build everything from the ground up, the game, the engine, the blogging tools, and cms you name I want to make it from scratch.

Going that route is fine if I just wanted to program cool stuff. I know it would be fun, and I would learn a lot. But it is going to take a really long time, because I have a day job, friends and need to make time to mow the lawn and take a shower at least once a week.

Too long for me, I&#8217;m desperate to make this game, publish something and make my vision a reality. My number two priority is to make this game a reality and I just don&#8217;t want to wait forever. (Number one is my health I need to get healthier.) So it is more important to me to publish the game than do it all myself. So I must find the best tools possible and accept there limitations, even if I would &#8220;do it so much better.&#8221;

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only person that has this problem I wish there was a vaccine!
