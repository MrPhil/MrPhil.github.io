[Chicago band Fall Out Boy sold 70,000 copies of their new album in one week after the music was featured on &#8220;Tony Hawk&#8217;s American Wasteland,&#8221; a skateboarding game, music scout Tim Riley said.](http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/01/6059.ars)

&#8220;They weren&#8217;t on the radio,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only thing you can attribute the sales to is the game.&#8221; Activision has doubled its music spending in the last five years, Riley added.
