I called this theme &#8220;Thisaway MrPhil&#8221; because it is a modification of the &#8220;Thisaway Green&#8221; template available at Blogger.com. &#8220;Thisaway Green&#8221; was created by [Dan Rubin](http://superfluousbanter.org/about/)

The copyright rules are unclear to me in this case, and frankly I don&#8217;t think it is worth figuring it out. Blogger allows you to use the templates. Blogger also let you export the html it generated your own server. Blogger also lets you modify the templates. Blogger doesn’t ask you to give them credit or the templates creators’ credit. Not sure what other restrictions they could enforce so I doubt I’m doing anything wrong here.

I&#8217;ve given credit to the creator and also admit I modified it. Hopefully I&#8217;ve cover the morally important points here. And as I believe moral issues are superior to legal I’ve therefore done the right thing.
