**The idea**: &#8211; [Make Many Games: Learn Many Things](http://gamasutra.com/blogs/author/AdrielWallick/953058/) and [Game A Week: Getting Experienced At Failure](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/RamiIsmail/20140226/211807/Game_A_Week_Getting_Experienced_At_Failure.php)

**Game A Week**: [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GameAWeek/), [subReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameaweek/)

**Level A Week**: same idea for level designers, some folks on the [Facebook group for Washington, DC Area Unity Users Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WAUUG/) are doing it. 

**Constraints**: Match your &#8220;A Week&#8221; with a gamejam theme using [CompoHub](http://compohub.net/)

**Inspiration clone a classic**:
