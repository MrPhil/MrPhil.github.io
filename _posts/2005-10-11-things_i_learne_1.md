&#8211; There is a weird battle between &#8220;Attach rate&#8221; and &#8220;Conversion Rate&#8221; going on because the consoles are measuring their &#8220;downloadable games&#8221; by game sold per console instead of sales per download
  
&#8211; Apple claims &#8220;$500 million of 3rd Party sales (non-apple stuff).&#8221; (I think they meant a year but it wasnt explicitly said.)
  
&#8211; developer.apple.com
  
&#8211; Developing in Linux is so mean streets difficult, it is now is referred to as &#8220;Ghetto Linux&#8221;
  
&#8211; Dual core systems are the future, so learn more about multi-threading
  
&#8211; I have no idea what &#8220;vectorization&#8221; really means
  
&#8211; Maybe I should think about buying Apple stock, oh wait I need that money to make my game
  
&#8211; XCode is free
  
&#8211; Shark is the greatest dev tool ever (it is a profiler)
  
&#8211; Chris Crawford thinks about stuff that make my brain wish is was having a beer
  
&#8211; Interactive story telling is such a weird wild concept that I \*fate intervenes and the narrator&#8217;s brain explodes\*
  
&#8211; \*destiny intervenes and some how the narrator&#8217;s brain was saved from exploding using a lame plot gimmick involving a time machine and coke bottle\*
  
&#8211; Casual game will be a $2 billion space by 2008
  
&#8211; Top 10 Causal Game developers:
  
&#8230;spend $50,000 to $150,000
  
&#8230;Have 1 to 3 programmers
  
&#8230;Have 1 or 2 artists
  
&#8230;Develop a game in about 6 months
  
&#8211; Royalties are a fuzzy science:
  
&#8230; Developers get 20% to 40%
  
&#8230; Publisher get 10% to 25%
  
&#8230; Distribution services get 10% to 20%
  
&#8230; Portals get 40% to 60%
  
&#8230; Money appears and disappears between 80% to 145% (Attention, that was humor)
  
&#8211; Causal Games are sold at $19.95 to $24.95
  
&#8211; Some games sell better at $24.95 than at $19.95
  
&#8211; Causal Games sell 5000 to 20,000 units
  
&#8211; Try Media loves Torque
  
&#8211; There are (can be) 11 milestones for a Causal Game Title
  
&#8230; Pre-Production
  
&#8230; Prototype
  
&#8230; Code Complete
  
&#8230; Content Complete
  
&#8230; Alpha
  
&#8230; Friends and family beta
  
&#8230; Beta
  
&#8230; Soft Launch (putting a game out on a small portal and testing different changes effect on conversion rate)
  
&#8230; Launch
  
&#8230; Post-Launch Updates (some portals like Yahoo will take months to put up a patched version of your game if ever)
  
&#8211; Portals are dieing for games and it makes their life easier if you have 12-24 Prototypes to show them (I was kinda of confused on this point but what is meant is that Portal&#8217;s don&#8217;t have the staff to deal with lots of developers and would prefer a handful of developers with a lot of games)
  
&#8211; Get a Mentor
  
&#8211; There is a great book out there called &#8220;Refactoring&#8221;
  
&#8211; There is a great testing company called &#8220;Testing Testing 123&#8221; and they arent over priced
  
&#8211; Get feedback using &#8220;Survey Monkey&#8221; it is free
  
&#8211; A self-funded games royalty rates are considered low at 15% and high at 42%, average is 30-35%
