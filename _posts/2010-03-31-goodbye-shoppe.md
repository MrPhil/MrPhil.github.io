I knew when Amazon.com bought Reflexive that my game shoppee&#8217;s days where numbered. It is a big reason why I left Vermont and found a &#8220;real&#8221; job.  Today, my instincts where proven correct, by this email:

&nbsp;

> Dear Valued Affiliate,
> 
> I wanted to write to you today to thank you for your participation in the Game Center Solution Affiliate Program and to inform you that as of June 30, 2010, Reflexive Entertainment, Inc. will be terminating the Game Center Solution Affiliate program to focus entirely on game development.
> 
> Between now and June 30, 2010, the Game Center Solution Affiliate Program will continue its business as usual. We will continue to provide web service and support and pay referral fees on every qualified sale through June 30, 2010. We will stop processing sales after that date and our agreement with you governing the Game Center Solution Affiliate Program will terminate on June 30, 2010.
> 
> You will continue to have access to the Control Center until July 31, 2010 at which time we will distribute your final royalty report to the email address we have on file and our agreement with you governing the Game Center Solution Affiliate Program will terminate. Please be sure your contact information is current in our system.
> 
> We wish you all the best and hope that we will have more opportunities to work together in the future.
>

> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> Lars Brubaker

Moral of the story: Don&#8217;t build a business based on something someone else can pull the plug on.
