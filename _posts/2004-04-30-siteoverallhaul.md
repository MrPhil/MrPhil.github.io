I switched the website to the ASP.Net platform today. I’m using the www.asp.net portal starter kit to give me a little framework, but I’ll probably make some changes to the code over time. I just didn’t feel like learning PHP and all those other open source technologies. So even though the web hosting is more expensive I’m able to do what I want faster. Woo hoo!
