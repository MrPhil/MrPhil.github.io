This is the home of Mr. Phil Games, a startup independent game developer. What is an independent game developer? Like independent films they are typically small budget, big-hearted creations whose creator has chosen artistic control and vision over big budget support and distribution. In Mr. Phil Games&#8217; case, Indie means it is all done by me: Philip J. Ludington.

Iâ€™m working in my free time to create a science fiction strategy game. A sort of Star Trek meets Risk meets World War II, a genre sometimes called 4X or empire builder. The player is put in charge of a fledgling spare-faring civilization and he must shepherd it through the hostile galaxy to victory. Naturally victory is a complicated condition and so it can be achieved in many different ways. Hear more about my on going work in my blog.
