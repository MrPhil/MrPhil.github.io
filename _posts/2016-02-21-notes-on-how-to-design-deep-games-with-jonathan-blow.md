  * It is built on first principals, what makes it special is your technique and view of the world.
  * It is not working on fundamentals, you need to be ready and already done training to get good.
  * Avoid burn out, take care of your Human Animal (see [Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).)
  * Sometimes you need to take a break, a good rule:

> You&#8217;re only allowed to take a break to work on something smaller than what you have already shipped.

  * Take Showers &#8211; you have to rest, make yourself open to ideas aka invite a visit from your Muse
