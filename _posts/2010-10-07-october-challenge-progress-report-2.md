A small step forward.  Worked on getting the win condition to trigger.

The trigger is firing, but I need to animated the target zone and the fact that you&#8217;ve hit it.  The text looks awful too.

I also got some business hat things done as well: signed up for Intel&#8217;s AppUp Developer whosywhatisit, Google Checkout thingy and a couple offical business forms with my county.  Can you believe you have to file for a permit to do work in your own home!?!  What is America coming too?  Anyways&#8230; tired&#8230; must sleep.
