I participated in the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org) this year.  It was my second appearence, the first time being in 2010 on [Space Exodus](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2011/space-exodus).

Here are my brainstorming notes (on right) and pitch (on left):

Essentially I wanted to make a QWOP style game about moving blood through the heart to the brain.  I was thinking that if you didn&#8217;t do it well enough the brain would loose oxygen and then the letters you need to press would change.  Sadly, no one wanted to join my team.

Instead I joined the [Heart Trampoline](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/heart-trampoline) team.

Also, Heart Trampoline is my January entry in the [One Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/xMrPhil) Jam/Challenge.
