Even though I&#8217;m not done I&#8217;ve decided to post my research so far on[SilverLight](http://web.archive.org/web/20080218202645/http://silverlight.net/). I&#8217;ve tried to find working examples for everything and cross-reference everything as much as I can. I apologize for the link happy post, but I want you to be able to get the info from the horse&#8217;s mouth and judge for yourself. First I&#8217;ll give you the executive summary. If you want more details follow the related link below.

#### Executive Summary

SilverLight allows you to deploy vector graphics and media rich applications through the browser unto Windows and Mac. Essentially it is a stripped down (currently 1 meg download for 1.0, 4 megs for 1.1) version of the .Net framework that runs in a browser (IE, Firefox, Safari and more planned.) It will allow games to switch to fullscreen mode, collect keyboard and mouse input, play videos and music seamlessly and save to a special sandbox area of the client.

The graphics are described in a new html like language called XAML which has a complex event system that allows the graphics to respond to changes in the game data. Think of a GUI layer that is responsible for itself, making changes to the way it looks based on user input and changes inside the game world.

One important thing to note is that search engines will be able to see the XAML. SilverLight should be viewed as a new API for the web. It isn&#8217;t just a way to embed games and videos on an html page. It will become a complete replacement for ASP.NET and HTML. Entire website will be made with XAML and run by SilverLight.

Is SilverLight a new gaming platform? Yes

Orr&#8217;s [Introduction to SilverLight](http://web.archive.org/web/20080218202645/http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/silverlight/IntroductionToSilverlight.aspx) &#8211; “Silverlight&#8217;s team has a long term secret goal of keeping the download size under 5MB. Shhhh! Don&#8217;t tell anybody!”

#### Misc

The [Tater Salad Blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20080218202645/http://caseyrayl.wordpress.com/) has the best firsthand account of using SilverLight to make games I&#8217;ve come across so far: [Silverlight Game Development Post Mortem](http://web.archive.org/web/20080218202645/http://caseyrayl.wordpress.com/2007/06/28/silverlight-game-development-post-mortem/)

Joel on Software recently wrote a post titled [Strategy Letter VI](http://web.archive.org/web/20080218202645/http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/09/18.html) although he doesn&#8217;t mention SilverLight and might not even be thinking about it I definitely think SilverLight could be the &#8220;second coming of Microsoft Windows.&#8221;
