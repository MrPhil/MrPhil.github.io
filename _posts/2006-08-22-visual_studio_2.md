Lately I have been having pain in my arm and wrist from using the mouse so much.  So I went looking for a keyboard cheat sheet for Visual Studio 2005.  I am hoping this will allow me to use the mouse less and give my wrist a rest.  Sadly, the best thing I could find was this video at [Channel 9](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/default.aspx) (I can’t get a lot of these to work with C#).  So using tips from the video and my own sleuth like skills I created my own cheat sheet which I share here for you future Google travelers.
