The city builder game [Dawn of Discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_1404) was released at the end of June and I&#8217;ve heard a lot of good buzz about it. It even got a [Metascore of 84](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery). It seems like the kind of game I would really like. I almost purchased it but then I noticed some fine print: &#8220;TAGES<sup>TM</sup> 3 machine activation limit.&#8221; I was shocked. Some research shows that it has caused a lot of backlash, earning it [1.5 stars on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Dawn-Discovery-Pc/product-reviews/B001VJBYZY/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1). I wonder, how much this has hurt sales?

After some research I found some hearsay that they&#8217;ll raise the restriction if you contact them and are a legitimate user. That&#8217;s good, but it still doesn&#8217;t easy my fears. I&#8217;ve found in general that support issues like that eventual disappear and you are left hanging. I&#8217;m the kind of user that plays games for years after they&#8217;re release. I&#8217;ve installed Medieval Total War countless times. When I buy a game it is more of an investment, and an activation limit reduces its value to me. If it was only $15 to $20 then it might be worth only playing three times. I hope in a year or so it comes out on Steam without the activation limits, and it&#8217;ll probably be cheaper too.

I wonder, how will this change Ubisoft&#8217;s profit formula?

Update: I&#8217;ve heard rumors that the 1.1 patch removed the DRM, but it appears to only apply to European Retail versions.
