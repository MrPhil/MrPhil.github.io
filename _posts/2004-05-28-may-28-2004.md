Experimenting today with creating and modifying the portal modules. There seems to be a lot of html inlining. Not sure I like that&#8230; seems messy to me. I&#8217;ll probably experiment with it later on. I also created some stored procedure in the database, which is a first for me! Remember the Maine, and think about all those soldiers waiting in boats in horrible weather to throw themselves at Fortress Europe beach 60 years ago.
