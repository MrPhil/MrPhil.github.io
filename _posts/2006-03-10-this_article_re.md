[The politicians are at it again](http://news.cnet.com/Senate-panel-OKs-video-game-study/2100-1047_3-6047750.html), trying to use the game industry to score points, all the while ignoring reality. I’m always suspicious when politicians want to make people stop doing something, especially if it has to do with the free market. The war on drugs is a great example of politicians wasting money, energy, foreign relationships and society’s good will to score political brownie points. I’d even argue that more people have died as a result. The reality is that as long as people want to do drugs someone is going to provide them. If supplying the market is illegal it will only marry it to hard core criminals. Politicians should focus on the real issue: Why do people WANT to do drugs and play violent video games.

It is also ignorant of them to think they can stop the creation of games that contain violence for two reasons. First, violence and death are a part of the real world and games must reflect reality to appeal to people becuase they live in the real world. Two, the Internet makes it very easy to distribute a digital product into the US. Just as the car companies move their headquarters over seas to Germany, Japan and Korea to avoid the US’s draconian tax system to survive so too can game developers move to avoid laws restricting content.
