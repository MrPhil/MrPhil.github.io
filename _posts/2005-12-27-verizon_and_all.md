[The Washington Post has a story about how Verizon and Allegheny Power put the brake on a Christmas tradition going back over sixty years.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/18/AR2005121801140.html) The city of Lonaconing, Maryland has a Christmas tradition of hanging lights on its streets during the holidays. This year the city made the mistake of trying to modernize their lighting system and once they got their utility company&#8217;s involved the corporations refused to help citing safe reasons. So instead of acting like a member of the community and working with the very people they depend on for revenue they left the city demoralized and lightless. Demonstrating part of the Corporate Fantasy; all activities must have a sufficient Return on Investment (ROI) in order to burden risks of the engagement. Unfortunately, large companies have mediocre middle management types perform these analyses and they do not have the imagination to consider the needs of the community, their moral, or the potential for goodwill generation. The gooey center of Large Corporation only understands one thing: “How much is it going to cost us?” Image if they had helped and this article was about how they saved the city&#8217;s 60 year old Christmas tradition! That would have been good for business and the community, right? Oh well, they are getting at little payback. A large display of The Grinch who Stole Christmas has been put up in front of the Verizon office.
