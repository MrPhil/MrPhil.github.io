Last .Planâ€™s Results:
  
So Iâ€™m definitely a T2D convert. Iâ€™ve halted all work on my custom engine and am going 100% T2D. I did the tutorial and liked it a lot. Hereâ€™s a small screen capture of my gameâ€™s starmap in T2D (can you find the fleet icon?)

And here it is zoomed out.

I also added a splash screen. 

Iâ€™ve stopped my work on adding Torque script as a language to Visual Studio. It will take a sizable effort to accomplish and Iâ€™d rather work on my game or website.

Iâ€™ve picked UltraEdit (v11) as my Toque Script editor because it is inexpensive, has the best smart indenting, allows me to add Torque Script as a language pretty easily, and I can customize the highlighting colors. The one feature it has that stands out among them all is the function jumping/listing tool. Navigating using this make life SOOOO much easier. 

The only thing I wish it had was the magic formatting feature you get with Visual Studio .Net. Oh well, maybe thatâ€™ll be in the next version. Hereâ€™s a list of why I eliminated all the other options (note the list is rough because some things I scratch off the second they where unintuitive or missing a feature I wanted):

[url=http://www.editplus.com/]EditPlus[/url] &#8211; No smart indenting and for $30 might as well get UltraEdit and get smart indenting! (To be fair this was my third choice)
  
[url=http://www.jedit.org/]jEdit[/url] with [url=http://torqueide.sourceforge.net]TIDE[/url] &#8211; Slow, function jumping system stupid, no brace formatting and no projects of course this will come back to haunt me when I want to debug.
  
[url=http://www.notepad.org/]NotePad[/url] â€“ Name a feature. It doesnâ€™t have it.
  
[url=http://www.eclipse.org/]Eclipse[/url] with [url=http://opensource.kruxgames.com/torquedit/]TorqueEdit[/url] â€“ My Microsoft centric brain canâ€™t comprehend your advance Java GUI concepts
  
[url=http://www.twinno.com/brainedpro/]Brain Editor Professional[/url] &#8211; Demo was expired when I installed it, didnâ€™t take time to fight with it
  
[url=http://www.context.cx/]ConTEXT[/url] &#8211; Good file browser, semi-auto-indenting, Free! I almost picked this one.
  
[url=www.multiedit.com]MultiEdit[/url] &#8211; $495!!! You realize what that kind of money that is? You can freaking get a new computer for $500! I doubt Microsoftâ€™s Visual Studio Express will costs more than that!
  
[url=www.slickedit.com]SlickEdit[/url] â€“ an eclipse plug-in, see My Microsoft centric brain above.
  
[url=vim.sf.net]Vim[/url] â€“ nice in that command line, telnet kind of way
  
[url=www.emacs.org]Emacs[/url] â€“ didnâ€™t bother, see Vim

[url=http://www.textpad.com/]Textpad[/url] &#8211; no brace matching formatting, or auto complete
  
[url=http://www.crimsoneditor.com/]Crimson Editor[/url] â€“ looked like so many I had tried already so I didnâ€™t bother
  
[url=http://home.t-online.de/home/Jens.Altmann/jfe_eng.htm]Jens&#8217; File Editor[/url] &#8211; according to website is doesnâ€™t have brace matching, function jumping or auto complete so I didnâ€™t bother downloading it, but it was a clever idea to give it a girls name.

I also figured out a cool way to make UltraEdit help me find compile errors in the console log. I added the log as a syntax language and defined the error messages as functions. This way they show up as a list in the function-jumping window. I promise to add it as a resource down the road when Iâ€™ve â€˜dog foodedâ€™ it for a while.

My new tasks:
  
&#8211; Add simple main menu screen with new game button
  
&#8211; Add short command line switch to by-pass the tedious splash screen and main menu I just got done adding. ðŸ˜€
  
&#8211; Get object picking so I can place more fleets
  
&#8211; Add Purchase
  
&#8212; Allow user to click on icons of items he wants to buy
  
&#8212; Allow user to click on items in â€˜shopping cartâ€™ to change mind about buying that ten billion dollar Battleship with full compliment of fighters
  
&#8212; Guess theyâ€™ll need a commit or next button to finish the phase.
