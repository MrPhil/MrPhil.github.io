One of the gotchas I pointed out earlier was that Validation and Intellisense doesn’t work right for XAML files. A related trap that took me quite a while to figure out is the WPF Designer in Visual Studio 2005 doesn’t understand SilverLight XML! I had to right click my XAML file and tell it to open with the XML Editor in order to make all the errors go away. Even then it still complains about the “x:name” attribute. This is what I think they meant. All quirks, I hope, God willing, will go away with Visual Studio 2008, Glory be to Digital Lord Gates.
