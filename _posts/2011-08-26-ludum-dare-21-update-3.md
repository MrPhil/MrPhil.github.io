The XNA version of my game now surpasses the Unity version. What&#8217;s working:

  * Player display
  * Player movement
  * Player collision with items
  * Background Board (no wall collision yet)
  * Door key displays
  * Player can pickup keys

<div>
  What still needs to be done:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Wall collision
    </li>
    <li>
      Door display (Locked and Open)
    </li>
    <li>
      Level transition
    </li>
    <li>
      Enemy display
    </li>
    <li>
      Enemy following
    </li>
    <li>
      Enemy killing you
    </li>
    <li>
      More Levels
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;m feeling like this list is too long to finish in 7 hours and 15 minutes. I also have a lot of chores around the apartment that need attention. So, I&#8217;m going knock the &#8220;can&#8217;t ignore&#8221; ones out and then hopefully I can sprint to the end!
